# Chessboard Vision Project  

## üìå Introduction  
This project is part of the **Computer Vision** course in the Master's in Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to detect chess pieces on a board from images, determine their positions using bounding boxes, and represent them in an 8x8 matrix format. The solution is implemented in Python and follows a structured image processing pipeline.

## üéØ Task Overview  
- **Input:** Chessboard image  
- **Output:**  
  - Total number of black/white pieces  
  - Bounding boxes around detected pieces  
  - 8x8 matrix representing piece positions  
- **Dataset:** 50 images for development, 10 unseen test images  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Python script (single file)  
  - Short report (max 2 pages)  

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow  
1. **Preprocessing:** Load and preprocess the image (grayscale conversion, thresholding, etc.).  
2. **Chessboard Detection:** Identify the board and correct for perspective distortion.  
3. **Piece Detection:** Use image processing techniques or machine learning to detect pieces.  
4. **Bounding Box Extraction:** Identify the coordinates of detected pieces.  
5. **8x8 Board Mapping:** Assign pieces to board squares and generate a matrix representation.  
6. **JSON Output:** Structure the results as per the project‚Äôs requirements.  
7. **Evaluation & Testing:** Validate with sample images and test dataset.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the `chessboard-vision.py` script:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd chessboard-vision
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment 

#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Script

- Make sure you have a input.json file in the same directory as the script. Here is an example of the input.json file:
```json
{
  "image_files": [
    "images/G000_IMG062.jpg",
    "images/G000_IMG087.jpg"
  ]
}
```

- Run the script with the following command:
```bash
python chessboard-vision.py
```

Note: The script will read the input.json file, process the images, and output the results in a JSON file named `output.json`.
The output will include the number of pieces, 8x8 matrix, and bounding box coordinates for each piece.
